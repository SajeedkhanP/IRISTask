
1) Error is happening during the call of "https://pro-fapi-osa.t-cg.co.uk/api/schools/organisationId/news?markAsRead=false" to the server.

i) The root cause of the failure is 404 Page not found - Which means the destination web page has been removed by the owner
https://osa-web.t-cg.co.uk/qatest

ii) Path of the server is also wrong.

Actual :- /api/schools/organisationId/news?markAsRead=false

Expected :- /api/schools/4055/news?markAsRead=false

iii) Also I had a observation that it is calling the ":method: OPTIONS" instead of "GET" method, which is working fine for the valid News Tab.



2) Description :- 
Steps to reproduce the issue:- 

i) Launch the URL "https://osa-web.t-cg.co.uk/qatest" in parallel with the network tab open in DevTools
